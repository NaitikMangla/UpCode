# Upcode – Grow with Code

**Upcode** is a developer-focused web platform that combines coding practice with deep self-analysis. It was built to help learners not just solve problems, but grow as problem-solvers — through intentional challenge curation, performance tracking, and a distraction-free coding interface.

## Why Upcode?

Most coding platforms focus purely on problem-solving. Upcode goes beyond that — it focuses on **learning through practice**, **tracking your growth**, and **identifying areas of improvement**.

Whether you're preparing for interviews or trying to level up your programming skills, Upcode offers a structured, insight-driven experience.

## Note

The project is currently in a **frozen state** due to team constraints. While the platform's core features like IDE, problem sets UI, and analysis system are implemented, **it is not fully usable** because:
- Problem content/data is incomplete
- End-to-end hosting and deployment are not set up
- Admin and backend authoring tools are built but not in use

This version serves as a functional prototype showcasing the product direction and vision.
